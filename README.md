## Introduction
The Culinary Delight Wonderful Weekly Dishes site provides weekly recipes
for anyone interested in preparing a tasty meal on an occasional or weekly
basis. All the meals presented are for three or four people and are chosen
for the simple home budget.

## Site Features
The main page provides an overview of the site and an introduction to the
dishes of the week, along with registration form, for email updates, a

The recipe page provides the user with an introduction to the dish, credits and 
an easy to use step-through images and text for each stage of the meal 
preparation and a list of ingredients and the utensils
required for the preparation. The dessert and main course are accessible
via the menu bar at the top of each page. In addition, the complete recipe

Images of the completed dishes are also provided, to whet the apetite of the
