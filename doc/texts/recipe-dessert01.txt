	a golden straw colour (caramel)
3. Pour the caramel into the cake tin evenly spread and allow to stand
	for 30 minutes. Butter the inner sides of the tin above the caramel line.
	Do next while waiting ..
4. Core, peel and cut the 200g bramley apples into 2cm chunks
5. Put the bramley apples and 2 tablespoons of caster sugar and 2 tablespoons
	of water into the saucepan, simmer for 5 to 10 minutes.
6. Once the bramley apples are soft, take off the heat and mash to a puree
	with a fork
7. Peel and core the eating apples, then slice thinly, about 5mm thick
8. Arrange a layer of the eating apples over the caramel in the baking tin
9. Scatter any remaining eating apple on top of the arranged layer
10. Spread the cooled bramley apple puree evenly over the top of the eating
	apples
11. Dust a board with plain flour using it to roll-out the puff-pastry 
	into a circle about 2.5cm larger than the tin
12. Cover the apple in the tin with the pastry circle, tucking the edges
	in at the sides. Cut a small cross in the centre of the pastry to let
	the steam out
13. Pre-heat the oven if necessary to 220 degrees C (200 for fan ovens). Bake
	in the oven for 35-40 minutes until the pastry is crisp and golden
14. Place a plate over the tin and then turn the two over, so that the tin
	empties with the fruit and caramel on top.
15. Serve with cream and enjoy!
