Javascript Code
    It would have been better to write more pseudo-code in the analysis
    so that the function layout could have been better written and 
    spot tested. The trade-off here is the time taken to maintain the 
    documentation versus reduced test/debug time. An extra half day/ day
    on the analysis would have payed-off. The current ordering of the
    functions is erratic.

    I avoided using objects for the javascript functions because this
    was not part of the spec. at this stage, but this would generally
    be better as it reduces the global clutter. This would have 
    required an extra few hours of analysis.

    The change of recipe step text makes the display "jump", it
    would be nice to have a transition effect for this. Estimate is
    three days trial/coding. The downside of this is that it makes
    the code more messy.
